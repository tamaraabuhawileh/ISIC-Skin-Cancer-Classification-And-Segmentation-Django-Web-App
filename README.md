# ðŸ”¬ ISIC Skin Cancer Classification and Segmentation Django Web App ðŸ”¬

This repository hosts the code for a Django-based web application designed for skin cancer analysis using the ISIC (International Skin Imaging Collaboration) dataset. The application incorporates machine learning models for both skin cancer classification and custom image segmentation, enabling users to submit skin photos for comprehensive analysis.

## Dataset Source:
- Semantic Segmentation: [ISIC 2018 Dataset](https://challenge.isic-archive.com/data/#2018)
- Classification: [ISIC 2019 Dataset](https://challenge.isic-archive.com/data/#2019)

ðŸš€ **Key Features:**
- **User Authentication:** Secure registration and login functionality to protect user data.
- **Photo Submission:** Intuitive interface for uploading skin photos for analysis.(UNET Architecture)
- **Classification Model:** Accurate identification of various skin cancer diseases(Xception Base Model)
- **Custom Segmentation:** Precise segmentation of melanoma regions within uploaded photos.
- **In-depth Analysis:** Detailed analysis reports providing insights into detected conditions.

ðŸ’¡ **Future Enhancements:**
- Continued model refinement and improvement for enhanced accuracy.
- Integration of additional features based on user feedback and emerging research findings.
- Perform object detection techniques on the ISIC dataset. (follow for more)

ðŸŒŸ **Contributions:** Contributions and feedback from the community are highly valued and encouraged!
